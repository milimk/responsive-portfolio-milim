                    BrainTest is a cross-platform application available on iOS,

                    I was responsible for conceptualizing and creating the best
                    user experience design for both consumer and business
                    products, from crafting flowcharts and wireframes to
                    developing prototypes and delivering the final product.

                  <p>
                    The products are tailored for senior individuals, which
                    require different design approaches, including larger fonts,
                    simplified navigation, and clear visual cues to ensure ease
                    of use and accessibility.

                    Mini-Me is an e-learning and entertainment brand for

                    Designing products for children requires special
                    considerations, such as easy navigation and parental
                    controls. It's essential to create engaging content that is
                    both educational and entertaining to capture and maintain
                    children's attention.

                    Company of Heroes 2 is a real-time strategy game for PC, set
                    during the Eastern Front battles of World War II, where
                    players control the Soviet Red Army. Developed by Relic

                    I was involved in creating the user interface for two
                    expansion packs, Western Front Armies and Ardennes Assault,
                    both featuring rich art styles that support WWII themes. The
                    UI elements were designed with inspiration from gameplay
                    elements such as metal, guns, dirt, and rough textures to
                    enhance the game's immersion and engagement.

                    As a part of SheCodes Coding Bootcamp, I created a Poem
                    Generator using their AI API. I used HTML, CSS and
                    JavaScript languages and Axios, Typewriter Animation and
                    SheCodes private API to make the AI calls.

                    Mini-Me is an e-learning and entertainment brand for
                    children that includes multiple products, such as videos,
                    games, books, an academy, and more.

                    From crafting the right user experience design to delivering
                    the final product with content management support and
                    maintaining the live product by analyzing key metrics, this
                    project provided me with a full range of product development

                    Designing products for children requires special
                    considerations, such as easy navigation and parental
                    controls. It's essential to create engaging content that is
                    both educational and entertaining to capture and maintain
                    children's attention.

                    Company of Heroes 2 is a real-time strategy game for PC, set
                    during the Eastern Front battles of World War II, where
                    players control the Soviet Red Army. Developed by Relic
                    Entertainment and published by SEGA, the game was released
                    in 2013.

                    I was involved in creating the user interface for two
                    expansion packs, Western Front Armies and Ardennes Assault,
                    both featuring rich art styles that support WWII themes. The
                    UI elements were designed with inspiration from gameplay
                    elements such as metal, guns, dirt, and rough textures to
                    enhance the game's immersion and engagement.
